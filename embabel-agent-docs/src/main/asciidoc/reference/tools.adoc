=== Tools

Tools are passed to LLMs to allow them to perform actions.

Embabel provides tools to LLMs in several ways:

* At action or `PromptRunner` level, from a tool group.
* At domain object level via `@Tool` methods authored by the application developer.

==== Tool Groups

Embabel introduces the concept of a *tool group*.
This is a level of indirection between user intent and tool selection.
For example, we don't ask for Brave or Google web search: we ask for "web" tools, which may be resolved differently in different environments.

TIP: Tools use should be focused.
Thus tool groups cannot be specified at agent level, but must be specified on individual actions.

==== Tool Objects

==== Tools on Domain Objects
