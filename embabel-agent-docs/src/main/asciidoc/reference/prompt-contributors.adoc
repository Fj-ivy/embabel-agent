=== Prompt Contributors

Prompt contributors are a fundamental way to structure and inject content into LLM prompts.
You don't need to use them--you can simply build your prompts as strings--but they can be useful to achieve consistency and reuse across multiple actions or even across multiple agents using the same domain objects.

They implement the `PromptContributor` interface and provide text that gets included in the final prompt sent to the LLM.
By default they will be included in the system prompt message.

==== Core Interface

All prompt contributors implement the `PromptContributor` interface with a `contribution()` method that returns a string to be included in the prompt.

==== Built-in Convenience Classes

Embabel provides several convenience classes that implement `PromptContributor` for common use cases.
These are optional utilities - you can always implement the interface directly for custom needs.

===== Persona

The `Persona` class provides a structured way to define an AI agent's personality and behavior:

[source,kotlin]
----
val persona = Persona.create(
    name = "Alex the Analyst",
    persona = "A detail-oriented data analyst with expertise in financial markets",
    voice = "Professional yet approachable, uses clear explanations",
    objective = "Help users understand complex financial data through clear analysis"
)
----

This generates a prompt contribution like:

----
You are Alex the Analyst.
Your persona: A detail-oriented data analyst with expertise in financial markets.
Your objective is Help users understand complex financial data through clear analysis.
Your voice: Professional yet approachable, uses clear explanations.
----

===== RoleGoalBackstory

The `RoleGoalBackstory` class follows the Crew AI pattern and is included for users migrating from that framework:

[source,java]
----
var agent = RoleGoalBackstory.withRole("Senior Software Engineer")
    .andGoal("Write clean, maintainable code")
    .andBackstory("10+ years experience in enterprise software development")
----

This generates:

----
Role: Senior Software Engineer
Goal: Write clean, maintainable code
Backstory: 10+ years experience in enterprise software development
----

==== Custom PromptContributor Implementations

You can create custom prompt contributors by implementing the interface directly.
This gives you complete control over the prompt content:

[source,kotlin]
----
class CustomSystemPrompt(private val systemName: String) : PromptContributor {
    override fun contribution(): String {
        return "System: $systemName - Current time: ${LocalDateTime.now()}"
    }
}

class ConditionalPrompt(
    private val condition: () -> Boolean,
    private val trueContent: String,
    private val falseContent: String
) : PromptContributor {
    override fun contribution(): String {
        return if (condition()) trueContent else falseContent
    }
}
----

==== Examples from embabel-agent-examples

The https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent-examples[embabel-agent-examples] repository demonstrates various agent development patterns and Spring Boot integration approaches for building AI agents with Embabel.

==== Best Practices

* Keep prompt contributors focused and single-purpose
* Use the convenience classes (`Persona`, `RoleGoalBackstory`) when they fit your needs
* Implement custom `PromptContributor` classes for domain-specific requirements
* Consider using dynamic contributors for context-dependent content
* Test your prompt contributions to ensure they produce the desired LLM behavior
